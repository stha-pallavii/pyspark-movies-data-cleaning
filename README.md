  Jupyter Notebook containing the data cleaning workflow, including:
  - Handling missing values.
  - Removing duplicates.
  - Standardizing data formats.
  - Preparing the dataset for analysis.

- **`cleaned_movies_dataset.csv`**:  
  The cleaned dataset after processing, ready for further analysis or use in machine learning models.

- **`data/`**:  
  Directory containing the raw dataset(s) used in the project. Ensure the necessary files are available before running the notebook.
